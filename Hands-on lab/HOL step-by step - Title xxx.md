# Predictive Maintenance for Remote Field Devicesmhands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on-lab, you will build an end-to-end industrial IoT solution. We will begin by leveraging the Azure IoT Central SaaS offerings to quickly stand up a fully functional remote monitoring solution. Azure IoT Central provides solutions built upon recommendations found in the [Azure IoT Reference Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot/). We will customize this system specifically for rod pumps. Rod pumps are industrial equipment that is heavily used in the oil and gas industry.  We will then establish a model for the telemetry data that is received from the pump systems in the field and use this model to deploy simulated devices for system testing purposes. 

Furthermore we will establish threshold rules in the remote monitoring system that will monitor the incoming telemetry data to ensure all equipment is running optimally, and can alert us whenever the equipment is running outside of normal boundaries - indicating the need for alternative running parameters, maintenance, or a complete shut down of the pump. By leveraging the IoT Central solution, users can also issue commands to the pumps from a remote location in an instant to automate many operational and maintenance tasks which used to require staff on-site. This lessens operating costs associated with technician dispatch and equipment damage due to a failure.

Above and beyond real-time monitoring and mitigating immediate equipment damage through commanding - you will also learn how to apply the historical telemetry data accumulated to identify positive and negative trends that can be used to adjust daily operations for higher throughput and reliability.

## Overview

The Predictive Maintenance for Remote Field Devices hands-on lab is an exercise that will challenge you to implement an end-to-end scenario using the supplied example that is based on Azure IoT Central and other related Azure services. The hands-on lab can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the lab to model a real-world experience and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solution.
